    % Microbial Genetic Algorithm to optimize an spm_imatrix() vector. This will find a better/locally optimal translation and orientation given the provided fitnessfunc by using the microbial genetic algorithm (MGA). The advantage compared to using stochastic descent as SPM does is that genetic algorithms can explore the whole solution space, even if it is non-continuous or non-differentiable, and is not affected by the curse of dimensionality.
    %
    % Inputs:
    % * genestart: a vector of a single candidate that can be fed to fitnessfunc(genestart). This will both be used as the reference candidate (so we ensure we don't return a worse solution), and to generate new candidates. genestart should be a 12 elements vector as made by spm_imatrix(svol.mat), but don't forget that spm_coreg.optfun and spm_hist2 will apply it on top of input_vol.mat, such that orientation_that_will_be_tested = pinv(spm_matrix(genestart))*input_vol.mat -- in spm_coreg you can see the full call to spm_hist2 being: VF.mat\spm_matrix(x(:)')*VG.mat -- so by default you want genestart to be [0 0 0 0 0 0] (as is done in spm_coreg, which means we start from input_vol.mat as-is without any modification), NOT spm_imatrix(input_vol.mat) which would be a transform that would be applied ON TOP of input_vol.mat
    % * maxdim: maximum dimension to generate rotations when combined with randomstart = true. In general, set maxdim = svol.dim
    % * popsize: size of the population. This number should be relative to the number of tournamentcount, a good number is 1/10th of tournamentcount, as to allow all candidates to be explored and recombined by the end of the algorithm.
    % * demesize: size of the deme, which is the subpopulation size inside the ring that will be used to find a candidate B to compare candidate A. See Inman Harvey's paper. A good value is demesize = 0.1 to 0.3 * popsize.
    % * fitnessfunc: fitness function to use, it should accept a single variable x which will be a vector of the same size as genestart. Tip: try to optimize this function to be super fast, as although this genetic algorithm uses caching to try to save some time, a computation expensive fitnessfunc will limit the number of tournamentcount you can do (and hence the likelihood of converging to a satisficing solution). Specify fitnessfunc like this: fitnessfunc = @(x) jointhistogramfitness(spmaux, template_vol, input_vol, x);
    % * recombinationrate: crossover rate, the probability that one loser's gene will be overwritten by the winner's.
    % * mutationrate: rate of randomly assigning a random value to one loser's gene.
    % * tournamentcount: number of rounds to find a winner and a loser candidates and update the loser's genes. A high value increases the likelihood of converging to a satisficing solution.
    % * multistart: number of independent rounds to relaunch the whole genetic algorithm, with a brand new population. A high value reduces the variance of the final result. This can be used to test the influence of different parameters values (ie, to hyper-optimize). Multistart allows to reduce variance since we restart from multiple starting points and travel different paths, but this does not help with converging to a better result, it's better to increase tournamentcount than multistartcount to improve performances. Increasing multistart is great to test different parameters (eg, recombinationrate or mutationrate) and see in one result whether the new parameter really improves the performance.
    % * randomstart: defines how the initial population is generated: false will generate a whole population as a copy of the input candidate genestart, true will keep genestart as the reference candidate but all other individuals will be randomly generated according to the randomgen function. If randomstart = true, randomgen needs to be a function accepting popsize as 1st argument and length of genestart as 2nd argument, and which generates popsize individuals to add in the pool. For example, if fitnessfunc = @(x)sum(x), randomgen can be @(popsize,numel_genestart)randi(10, popsize, numel_genestart)
    % * randomgen: function that defines how the initial population is randomly generated when randomstart == true. randomgen should expect 2 parameters: popsize and numel(genestart).
    % * mutatefunc: defines how the mutation is done (ie, how random values are calculated to be assigned to loser's genes). It should expect one parameter which is the locus location i, so that a different mutation scheme can be applied depending on where in the vector we are mutating. If false, will apply a different function (and hence different ranges of values) for translation, rotation and shearing. Example: mutatefunc = @(i)randi(10)
    % * truerandom: defines whether the function is deterministic (false) or non-deterministic (true or a rand('seed') integer)
    % * onlyrigid: if true (default), only rigid-body transforms will be generated (ie, translation and rotation). If false, scale and shearing will also be explored.
    %
    % Outputs:
    % * best: the locally optimal candidate imatrix with all the transform parameters as a 12 items vector (use spm_matrix(best) to transform to an orientation matrix).
    % * bestfit: fitness score of the best candidate.
    % * bestfitstd: standard deviation over all multistart rounds (allows to assess performance variance by evaluating the variability of the current set of parameters).
    % * bestpool and bestpoolfit: all the best candidates across the multistart rounds. This can be used externally to manually select the best candidate using another fitnessfunction (possibly more precise but more time consuming, but since the set is reduced this is faster).
    %
    % Example usage: [best, bestfit, bestfitstd] = mga_imatrix([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8], 100, 10, @(x)sum(x), 0.7, 0.25, 1000, 1000, true, @(popsize,numel_genestart)randi(10, popsize, numel_genestart))
    % another example with a smaller number of tournament rounds and hence smaller population, with similar performances: [best, bestfit, bestfitstd] = mga_imatrix([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8], 10, 3, @(x)sum(x), 0.7, 0.25, 100, 1000, true, @(popsize,numel_genestart)randi(10, popsize, numel_genestart))
    %
    % Tips: The 4 most important parameters to hyper-optimize for accuracy performance are: popsize, demesize, recombinationrate and mutationrate. Assess using (maximizing) bestfit and (minimize) bestfitstd with a high number of (>1000) multistart rounds, which would mean that the genetic algorithm with your parameters and fitnessfunc can reach a high score while having low variance. Also, increasing tournamentcount of course allows the algorithm to converge to a better solution, so optimize your fitnessfunc to be super fast (can use caching for example).
